Create an Apex class with a method that returns a list of strings
Create an Apex class with a method that returns a list of formatted strings. The length of the list is determined by an integer parameter.
The Apex class must be called StringListTest and be in the public scope
The Apex class must have a public static method called generateStringList
The generateStringList method must return a list of strings
The method must accept an incoming Integer as a parameter, which will be used to determine the number of returned strings
The method must return a list of strings. Each element in the list must have the format Test n, where n is the index of the current string in the list. For example, if the input is 3, then the output should be ['Test 0', 'Test 1', 'Test 2']. Remember that in Apex, the index position of the first element in a list is always 0.
